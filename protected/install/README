There are several files here.  This is to facilitate moving between the official Storytlr code and my fork.  Read carefully!
=========
database.sql - For a fresh install, entirely from this codebase.
migration-0.9.2.sql - Migrating from "official" 0.9.2 to this codebase.


== [ New Install/Upgrade Branch Explanation] ==
Here is the logic behind the new install/upgrade scripts.

=== [ Install ] ===

1. Enter index.php
2. Look for protected/install/install.php
3. If it exists, load it up.
4. Check for protected/config/config.ini
5. If that exists, bail out and ask that the user remove install.php
6. Otherwise, check their requirements
7. If it looks good, show them the form.
8. On submit it all starts over again, except this time we take action.
9. Meaning, we write to the DB and write the config file.

=== [ Upgrade ] ===

There is a new directory called protected/install/version.

In this directory there should be a 0 byte file for each version we upgrade to.  So for a site that was installed as 0.9.2 and later upgraded to 0.9.3, there should be two files in this directory, protected/install/version/0.92 and protected/install/version/0.93

The file names come from a new constant, STORYTLR_VERSION_NUMBER, which is used soley for this purpose, and is a comparable float version of the STORYTLR_VERSION constant.  To get a comparable float, I dropped the dot between the minor and micro revision numbers.

Here is the proposed upgrade process:

1. If the protected/install/version/STORYTLR_VERSION_NUMBER file does not exist, then...
2. Load protected/install/upgrade.php
3. Determine what the largest version number is in protected/install/version/
4. Run all the migration scripts that are in protected/install/upgrade/
